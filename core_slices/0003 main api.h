The Protocol
============

The Protocol struct defines the callbacks used for the connection and sets it's

For concurrency reasons, a protocol instance SHOULD be unique to each
connections. Different connections shouldn't share a single protocol object
(callbacks and data can obviously be shared).

All the callbacks receive a unique connection ID (a localized UUID) that can be
converted to the original file descriptor when in need.

This allows facil.io to prevent old connection handles from sending data
to new connections after a file descriptor is "recycled" by the OS.

Listening to Incoming Connections
===

Listening to incoming connections is pretty straight forward.

After a new connection is accepted, the `on_open` callback is called. `on_open`
should allocate the new connection's protocol and call `fio_attach` to attach
the protocol to the connection's uuid.

The protocol's `on_close` callback is expected to handle any cleanup required.

    // Write back the message
