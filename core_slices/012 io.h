The Protocol
============

The Protocol struct defines the callbacks used for a family of connections and
sets their behavior. The Protocol struct is part of facil.io's core design.

All the callbacks receive a unique connection ID that can be converted to the
original file descriptor when in need (which shouldn't really happen).

This allows facil.io to prevent old connection handles from sending data to new
connections after a file descriptor is "recycled" by the OS.

Listening to Incoming Connections
===

Listening to incoming connections is pretty straight forward:

* `on_open` should "attach" the new connection using `fio_attach_fd`.

* Once listening is done, cleanup is performed in `on_finish`.

The following is an example echo server using facil.io:
